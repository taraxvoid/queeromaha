Directory of queer/trans groups, venues and spaces in Omaha.

## Requirements

- \*nix
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as drop-in Node interpreter replacement, package manager and test runner
- (optional) [volta](https://volta.sh/) for node ver wrangling
- (optional) [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) for managing live deployments

## Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) for static site generation and light SSE
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for lint
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for mobile and desktop browser testing
- [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit tests

## Local Development

### Dependencies

```
# install JS deps
bun install --development

(optional) To run e2e tests
bunx playwright install --with-deps
```

### Running locally

```
# start local astro server w/ HMR at localhost:4321
bun run dev
```

## Deployment

### Via CI

The Netlify GitHub app is installed for this repo, which creates a "preview deployment" on (non-draft) Pull Requests.

Merges to `main` (protected branch) will deploy the production site.

### Manually

```
# install netlify CLI globally
bun install -g netlify-cli

# authenticate
netlify login

# link repo with Netlify project
netlify link

# create a test deployment
netlify deploy

# after validation, deploy production
netlify deploy --production
```

### Lint and Tests

Pull Requests must pass lint and include relevant unit/end-to-end tests. 

Accessibility for motion-sensitivity, color, fonts, reduced scrolling, tapping affordances, "go to top" are table stakes.

This project uses Husky hooks which you can install locally to automatically lint and test on pre-commit and pre-push.

```
bunx husky init
```

You can run lint (via biome) manually

```
bun run lint # check formatting
bun run format # auto-fix formatting
```

You must add/update unit tests for code changes. 

End-to-end tests are strongly recommended for commits that touch the frontend.

```
bun run test:unit # vitest
bun run test:e2e # Playwright mobile/ desktop browsers
bun run test:e2e:a11y # Accessibility via axe
bun run test:lighthouse # Lighthouse audit (SEO, perf)
```

## Conventional Commits & Changelog

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for all new commits.

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Common types used here:

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature or content addition |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `chore` | Maintenance, deps, config (no production change) |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `refactor` | Code restructure, no behavior change |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `ci` | CI/CD config |
| `revert` | Reverting a previous commit |

Examples:

```
feat(ical): add end_time support to recurring events
fix: correct slug collision on renamed items
chore(deps): bump astro to 5.x
docs: document git-cliff setup in README
```

### Enforcement

The `commit-msg` Husky hook runs [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org) against every commit. It is **advisory only** — it prints a friendly hint but never blocks a commit. History before this convention was adopted is left as-is.

### AI-assisted commit messages

`bun run commit` runs [opencommit](https://github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit) (`bunx oco`) to draft a Conventional Commit message from the staged diff. One-time setup:

```bash
bunx oco config set OCO_AI_PROVIDER=<provider> OCO_API_KEY=<key>
```

### Changelog (git-cliff)

The changelog is generated from git history by [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org), configured in `cliff.toml`. Commits that don't parse as Conventional Commits are silently excluded.

**Install git-cliff** (standalone binary, not an npm package):

```bash
brew install git-cliff
```

**Regenerate `CHANGELOG.md`** from the full git history:

```bash
bun run changelog
```

**Preview unreleased entries** (commits since the last tag, no file write):

```bash
bun run changelog:unreleased
```

**How `cliff.toml` works:**

- `conventional_commits = true` — parses the standard `type(scope): message` format
- `filter_unconventional = true` — silently drops non-conventional commits instead of erroring
- `commit_parsers` — maps types to emoji-prefixed groups (Features, Bug Fixes, etc.) and sets sort order via `<!-- N -->` prefixes
- `commit_preprocessors` — rewrites `(#123)` issue references into GitHub links
- `postprocessors` — replaces the `<REPO>` placeholder with the actual GitHub URL
- `topo_order_commits = true` — orders commits topologically within each release

#### Link Checker

`bun run check:links` parses the built `dist/` HTML and markdown for external
links, tests them against the live web, and reports failures. It runs in CI on
every PR and weekly via the [Check Links workflow](.github/workflows/check-links.yml).

Run it locally:

```
bun run build && bun run check:links
```
